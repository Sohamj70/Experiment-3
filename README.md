**~_Aim_**

To study and understand the concept of tuples in Python, including their creation, indexing, immutability, repetition, concatenation, and common tuple operations using Python programs.

**~_Theory_**

Python provides several built-in data types to store collections of data. One such data type is a tuple.

A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements enclosed in parentheses (). Tuples can store elements of different data types such as integers, strings, and boolean values.

_Key Characteristics of Tuples_

- Ordered: Elements have a fixed position and can be accessed using indexing.

- Immutable: Once created, the elements of a tuple cannot be modified, added, or removed. Allows duplicate values.

**Tuple Operations Studied**
- Creation of tuples

- Indexing and negative indexing

- Immutability demonstration (error when trying to modify)

- Tuple repetition using * operator

- Tuple concatenation

- Built-in functions such as:

- len() : to find length

- min() and max() : to find smallest and largest values

- sum() : to calculate total

- sorted() : to sort elements

- id() : to check memory location

These operations help in understanding how tuples behave differently from mutable data types like lists.

**_Algorithm_**
1. Start the program.
2. Create a tuple with different data types and display it using print().
3. Access tuple elements using positive and negative indexing.
4. Attempt to modify a tuple element to demonstrate immutability.
5. Create a tuple using repetition operator (*).
6. Use built-in functions like len(), min(), max(), sum(), and sorted() on a tuple.
7. Perform tuple unpacking to store values in separate variables.
8. Use conditional statements to check results based on tuple values.
9. Count occurrences of elements in a tuple using count() and check membership using in.
10. Display the output and stop the program


**_Conclusion_**

From this experiment, it is concluded that tuples are immutable data structures in Python used to store multiple values in a single variable. Tuples provide data safety, better performance, and are useful when the data should not be modified. Through this experiment, we successfully studied tuple creation, indexing, immutability, repetition, concatenation, and various built-in tuple functions, gaining a clear understanding of their usage and applications in Python programming.
